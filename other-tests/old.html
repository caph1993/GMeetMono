<h1>Analysis of GMeet algorithm</h1>
September 2022.


<div (component)="latticeCode"></div>

In this document, we consider the `GMeet` algorithm, invented by Camilo Rueda, and analyze many implementations, including several na√Øve ones, the algorithm `GMeetPlus` proposed by Camilo Rueda, and some others found by me (Carlos Pinz√≥n) and Frank Valencia.
`GMeet` was designed to solve the problem of computing the meet of two or more join-endomorphisms.
However, as we discuss in this document, `GMeet` solves a more general problem without any modification.
It finds the <i>maximal join-endomorphism below any given arbitrary function</i>.

Throughout this document we use the following notation.
$L$ is a non-empty finite lattice with order $\sqleq$ and join and meet operators $\join, \meet$.
The bottom element of $L$ is $\bot$.
The set of all endomorphisms (functions $f:L\to L$) is denoted as $\calF$, and it is a lattice with the order $$
f \sqleqF g \iff (\forall x\in L)\ f(x)\sqleq g(x).
$$
The join and meet operators in $\calF$ (i.e. $\joinF$ and $\meetF$) are the pointwise join and meet operators in $L$.
The endomorphisms that preserve least upper bounds and map $\bot$ to $\bot$ are called <i>join-endomorphisms</i>, and $\calE\subseteq\calF$ is the set of all join-endomorphisms, that is,$$
\calE\eqdef\set{f:L\to L \given f(\bot)=\bot \,\wedge\, \lr{\forall a,b\in L}\,f(a\join b)= f(a)\join f(b)}.
$$
The order $\sqleqE$ for $\calE$ is defined as the restriction of $\sqleqF$ to $\calE$, and with this order, $\calE$ is also a lattice.
The join operator $\joinE$ coincides with $\joinF$ (pointwise $\join$), but the meet $\meetF$ does not coincide with $\meetF$.

To begin, we present `GMeet` in its original form.

`GMeet` starts letting $h = f\meetF g$, which is an upper bound for $f\meetE g$.
Then, it successively finds conflicts of the form $h(a\join b) \neq h(a)\join h(b)$ and resolves them by making changes to $h$, always downwards, and never further down than the objective $f\meetE g$.
More precisely, letting $h$ and $h'$ be the functions before and after an iteration of the `while` loop in `GMeet`, the following invariant is preserved:
$$
(f\meetE g) \sqleqF h' \sqltF h \sqleqF (f \meetF g).
$$
This invariant is proved in the paper...
Taking into account that the algorithm is always making changes ($h' \sqltF h$) in the finite lattice $\calF$, and that $h$ satisfies $h\in\calE$ if and only if it has no conflicts, it is clear that this invariant guarantees both the termination and success of the algorithm.

If we enforce the monotonicity of $h$ as an invariant in `GMeet`, we derive the `GMeetMono` algorithm, shown below.

$\mathtt{GMeetMono}(f, g)$:

    if $h(a\join b) \sqgt h(a) \join h(b)$:

      for each $x \sqleq a\join b$
      <div class="indent-1em">
        $h(x) \leftarrow h(x) \meet c$
      </div>
    </div>

  return $h$

`GMeetMono` preserves the same invariant of `GMeet` on each iteration of the `while` loop, but in addition, it guarantees that $h'$ is monotone, i.e. $h'(a) \sqleq h'(b)$ for all $a\sqleq b$.
Monotonicity implies that all conflicts are of the form $h(a\join b) \sqgt h(a)\join h(b)$, hence only one of the rules in `GMeet` should be applied.
After applying it, the change is propagated from $a\join b$ down in $L$ in order for $h'$ to be monotone.
This update of all descendants of $a\join b$ is compatible with the invariant of `GMeet` because the target $f\meetE g$ is always monotonic.


A remarkable fact about both algorithms is that they serve to accomplish a more general task than finding the meet $f \meetE g$ of two join-endomorphisms.
It can be shown** (Frank and Carlos Pinz√≥n agree on this) that for every monotone function $h\in\calF$, the concept of a <i>maximal join-endomorphism $h^*$ below $h$</i> is well-defined.
If we ignore the first step of the algorithms, and assume the input to be an arbitrary monotone function $h$, then the algorithms are effectively finding this maximal $h^*\in\calE$ with $h^*\sqleqF h$.

**This follows easily and directly from the fact that $\joinF=\joinE$, because for any $f$, if there were two different maximal functions $f_1,f_2\in\calE$ below $f$, then $f\geq f_1 \joinF f_2 = f_1 \joinE f_2 \in \calE$, which is absurd.

Using the same argument, the <i>maximal monotone $h^*$ below $h$</i> is also well-defined.

Before entering into the algorithms, we present the following demo in which you can run tests with random functions on random lattices.
<!-- The tests generate randomly a monotone function $h$, feeds it to each of the available implementations, and checks that the outputs match.
For the particular goal of computing $f \meetE g$, the input $h$ would be $f \meetF g$, but the tests are carried out in general for arbitrary monotone input functions. -->

<!-- For the comparison, we will run `GMeet`, i.e. Santiago's improvements to `GMeet`, which is $O(n^3)$, unlike the na√Øve implementation of `GMeet` of $O(n^4)$. -->


The `GMeet` algorithm is implemented as `GMeetNaive`, which uses a double for loop for the existence check, repeating until no conflicts exist.
The complexity of this algorithm is theoretically $O(n^4)$ because each node may decrease its value at most $n$ times, hence at most $n^2$ updates to conflicts will be performed, each requiring $n^2$ tests to find the respective conflict.

A theoretical improvement for `GMeet` is `GMeetPlus`, which has a worst-case complexity of $O(n^3)$ instead of $O(n^4)$, however, as you can notice live from the tests, `GMeet` performs less operations on average than `GMeet`.
EVEN IN THE WORST CASES!!

The idea of `GMeetPlus` is to keep track of the pairs $a,b$ that may potentially be in conflict to speed up the main loop.
The details are in the paper??, as well as the explanation of why it is $O(n^3)$.

In the implementation, I must warn that there is a step of which I am not convinced.
Namely, when we clear `sup[xy]`, I do not fully understand why `con[xy]` is unaltered.
I need someone to explain me that part.

The following variables that are used in the algorithms are present in the lattice `L` and are assumed to be precomputed:
```javascript
const {n, m, lub, leq, glb, geq, gt, lt, children, isChild,
  walkDown, walkUp, parents, top, bottom, topoUpDown, topoDownUp} = L;
```
Notation:
`n` is the number of nodes in the lattice.
`m` is the number of edges in the Hasse diagram of the lattice.
`lub[a][b]` is the join (least upper bound) of `a` and `b`.
`glb[a][b]` is the meet (greatest lower bound).
`leq[a][b]` is the boolean for $a \sqleq b$.
`geq[a][b]` is the boolean for $a \sqgeq b$.
`lt[a][b]` is the boolean for $a \sqlt b$.
`gt[a][b]` is the boolean for $a \sqgt b$.
`children[b]` is the list of (direct) children of $b$.
`parents[a]` is the list of (direct) parents of $a$.



The implementation of the algorithms, including the counters is shown below.
